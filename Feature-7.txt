this is feature 7 with good code

always pull to your pc and make changes in dev and then push to dev get it approved and then merge it to main 

always pull from github to your local system in dev branch make the changes push it to github and from github merge it to main 

always pull from main to local system as there are many working in company 

sahi he bhai main branch me file me changes kiye mene fir main branch se local main pe pull kiya aur dev pe checkout karke main se merge kiya to sare changes dikh gaye
